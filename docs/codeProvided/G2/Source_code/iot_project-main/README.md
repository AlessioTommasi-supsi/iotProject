## Descrizione

As part of the Internet of Things (IoT) course, we developed an integrated system using an ESP32 board and an Esam E2002BL device \cite{3}, a network analyzer. The project involved using the ESP32 in two distinct operational modes: slave mode and master mode. In slave mode, the ESP32 received data requests from a software on the PC, such as Modscan, and responded with the requested information. In master mode, the ESP32 directly queried the E2002BL device to gather the necessary data. One of the main functionalities of the system was the ESP32's ability to create a Wi-Fi network, allowing connection to an existing network. Subsequently, the ESP32 acted as a web server, offering a configuration page that enabled users to view, add, delete, and modify registers in an interactive table. Additionally, the system included a real-time analytics page to monitor the values of a single register. For communication between devices, we used the Modbus RTU protocol, ensuring reliable and efficient data transmission between the system components.

## Requisiti

- ESP32
- Two RS-485 transceiver modules
